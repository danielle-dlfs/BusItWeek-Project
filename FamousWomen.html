          Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace (Born Byron; 10 December 1815 â€“ 27 November 1852)
          was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's
          proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.
          </p>
          <p>
          She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation,
          and created the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.
          As a result, she is often regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of
          a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.
